        <h2>Shipping & Delivery Policy</h2>

        <p>
            This Shipping & Delivery Policy outlines how LAKSHYA 2K26 handles delivery of services after payment. 
            Since our platform sells **digital event registrations and passes**, no physical shipment is involved.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Nature of Services</h3>
        <p>
            LAKSHYA 2K26 offers registrations for cultural, technical and sports events.  
            All services are **completely digital** and delivered electronically.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Delivery of Confirmation</h3>
        <p>
            Once the payment is successfully completed via Razorpay:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A confirmation email is sent to your registered email ID.</li>
            <li>Your registration details will appear instantly under the **My Registrations** section.</li>
            <li>A digital receipt is emailed automatically.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Delivery Time</h3>
        <p>
            Delivery is **instant**.  
            You should receive your confirmation email within **1–5 minutes** of payment.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Non-Receipt of Confirmation Email</h3>
        <p>
            If you do not receive your confirmation email:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check your spam/junk folder.</li>
            <li>Verify your email address in your profile.</li>
            <li>Contact our support team at  
                <strong>support@testify-lac.com</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Incorrect Email / Mobile Number</h3>
        <p>
            If a user enters an incorrect email or mobile number during registration, LAKSHYA 2K26 is not responsible
            for failed delivery.  
            However, you may contact support for correction.
        </p>

        <h3>6. No Physical Shipping</h3>
        <p>
            LAKSHYA 2K26 does not ship any physical goods.  
            All deliverables (registration ID, confirmation mail, receipts) are provided digitally only.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Event Entry</h3>
        <p>
            After successful payment, your registration ID is used for verification at the event venue.  
            You will not receive any courier/postage-based material.
        </p>
